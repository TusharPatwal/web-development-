       <h1>Hello World!</h1>
       <a href="https://www.amazon.in/">amazon</a>
       <p>We sincerely believe that basic HTML knowledge is essential to
              designing, building, and maintaining readable and workable Web
              pages. Our goal in this book is to explain what HTML, XHTML, and
              CSS are and how they work, and then to show you exactly how to
              use them to best advantage.
       </p>
       <p>Along the way, we will examine the principles and best practices
              that govern Web page design and construction, and help you
              understand how to make your content accessible to the broadest
              possible audience.
       </p>
       <p>By the time you work your way through this book’s contents, you
              should feel comfortable with creating and managing your own Web
              site. You should also understand what it takes to identify your
              audience, communicate with that audience, and keep your content
              fresh and interesting to keep them coming back for more.
       </p>
       <p>Sincerely,</p>
       <p>Jeff Noble and Ed Tittel, your humble authors</p>
